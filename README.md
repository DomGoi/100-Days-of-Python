Welcome to my **Python Adventure** repository.

Every day I plan to post my Python mini project which I will be making through 100 days of coding bootcamp to learn coding in Python. 

I know that most of these projects won't be groundbreaking, but it will help to keep myself in line, as well as document my journey.

So I guess let's go and see where the code takes me!!!
